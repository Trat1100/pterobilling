## Status of the project

This project is currently not being actively developed.

It also depends on `payment-system`, which is an unified payment gateway I developed for my projects. It's source code it NOT public yet, so if you plan on using this project, you need to implement your own solution for payments.

## Requirements
  - PHP 7.4+
  - MySQL/MariaDB
  - Pterodactyl 0.7

## Installation
  - Deploy this Laravel app;
  - Configure .env variables;
  - Run `panel:sync-all` to sync stuff from Pterodactyl;
  - Configure scheduler and queue worker;
  
## .env file

 - **`RELEASED`** - if `true` users are allowed to register;
 - **`BROADCAST_DRIVER`** - set to `pusher` if you want auto-refresh on server install (and also configure Pusher credentials .env variables);
 - **`QUEUE_CONNECTION`** - always set to `database` or something similar, lots of monitoring jobs are dispatched while creating servers;
 - **`PAYMENT_SYSTEM_URL`** - URL for `payment-system` endpoint (this project is not public);
 - **`PTERODACTYL_URL`** - base URL for Pterodactyl panel (don't end with /). This is used for user redirections when using clicking the `Go to panel` button;
 - **`PTERODACTYL_API_ENDPOINT`** - endpoint used for API communication;
 - **`PTERODACTYL_API_KEY`** - Pterodactyl **application** API key;
 - **`PTERODACTYL_CLIENT_KEY`** - Pterodactyl **user** API key (create one using an admin account, we need this to controle server power and a few other essential things);
 - **`SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN`** - always a good idea to have Sentry setup;
